        <u>The style guide</u>
        <br>
        The style that the website is trying to give in terms of the theme: is keeping up with the social media "trends",
        what is trending in terms of colorways, content, and images.
        the colors that are geing used in this website are the mostly colors of the social media platform logos, the colors are drawn from there. 
        
        <img src="../../Images/style guide 1 .png" width="90%" height="450" alt="Screenshot of homepage and colour way " title="screenshot of website style guide">
        <br> 
        Looking at the academical work wireframe, and how that page is geing style, it took inspiration from the grid format that instagram uses for the users posts and profiles. 
         the brightness of some aspects of the website are taken from the fact that social media tends to very colorful, and almost an escape from reality,
         trying to discover and use different colors to match the theme of the website and the content there of, the narrative of the website will be in the colors and the ways that things are represented.

        <u>The Rational</u>
        <br>
        Rational : why it look the way it looks. 
        the webiste is design is such a way that it is relatable to the the website and the purpose of the webiste. The color scheme is a mixture and taken from the instagram logo colors
        it helps making it soft and the usage of the light pink background is part of the way that social media is my view is seen as the new " soft life " notion. 
        the layout of the webiste is designed is such a way that it also relates to the way some social media platforms are layed out, having some opetion hidden fromthe home page, helps with the better flow and navigation. 
        i created the wesbsite in such a way that it is incopoorative of the way that people engage and interact with social media platforms. the logo and colour way as describe and mentioned in the style guide. it is incopoorative of the different platforms that
        i used to investigate the way in which these platforms influence our lives and shopping habits as consumers and users of these platforms
