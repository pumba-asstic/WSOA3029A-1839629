            <p>This chapter deals with how it is up to the audience in how they interpret the data communicated to them, the data needs to be clear enough to the audience so that there is no need for the author to explain the data to the audience, it also says that the way the data is represented is depended on in which the space the audience is found and the type of goals they have set out for them. The data that is represented to scholars is different to the data that is represented to a newspaper reader, so goes for the data that is represented to a television audience the data is to be different from those of a scholar and a newspaper reader.  These different audiences’ server different purposes and have different goals, the space in which the audience lies in determines the way the data needs to be presented.</p> 
            <p>The authors of chapter 9 talk about learning the background knowledge and experiences of the audience. This is broken into 3 key areas that the content authors/ producers need to know more and how it would make more of an effective communication with data-driven data. </p>
            <ol>
            	<li> How literate is the audience in terms of data and visualization? and what can be done to increase it? </li>
            	 <li>How knowledgeable is the audience in terms of jargon, domain expertise, and other background knowledge? </li>
            	<li>What are audience expectations about the design of visualization? such as style, tone, or the use of iconography.</li> 
            </ol>
            <p>The above areas is what content producers should ask themselves when doing research of which audience they want to present they information to, the more knowledge they have about the audience they are trying to reach the more effective the data and the story is going to be communicated to the audience and the less over explaining is needed for the producers.</p> 
            <p>Learning what the media wants and what it needs helps with the gratifications from the audience, knowing that people use data- driven information for many different reasons some maybe personal such as health others might be for political reasons such as the elections, using the gratifications framework is what is need to know how to influence people cause we know that people are easily influenced by the media they consume that have a social and psychological underline. There are four motivations for media consumptions that the producers need to look at that helps the way the data is going affect the audience and they way that the data is communicated.</p>
            <ul> 
            	<li>Staying informed about current information, satisfying curiosity and self-education</li> 
            	<li>Gaining insight into oneself or seeing models for other’s behaviours </li>
            	<li>Socially interaction and connecting with others, or as a basis for social conversation or developing empathy </li>
            	<li>As a relaxing entertainment or diversion </li>
             </ul>   
            <p>When taking in these above mentions areas as to why people consume media, it help the author in the way they choose to structure their data, if the data is more for an audience that consumes media as a relaxing method  the data should align with that purpose, the media that is showcased on social media platforms is more for relaxing or a diversion from reality, if a content producer is using social media as a platform to communicate information about COVID-19 or any other social issue, the representation of that data needs to be catchy and to be able to make the audience engage with it, cause different audiences have different attention spans so it needs to be catchy enough to make the audience create a conversation amongst themselves. </p>
            
            <p>This chapter deals with a lot of things that help the producers with tips in how to engage effectively and making data-driven information work with the audience and the space they find they find themselves in. </p>
