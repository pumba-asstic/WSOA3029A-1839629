            <img src="../../Images/the artwork.png"  width="90%" height="450" alt="" title="">

            <p>Looking at the artwork and the strategies that it communicates, it suppose to communicates the tools and the features of Instagram tools that are used by small and online businesses ,where they use to promote and market their business, looking at the way that the artwork works is a in a spinning wheel carousel  way, the images  show a way that the business owners would use these tools in rotation,  the wheel spins in a 45 degree angle.
<p>The representation of the wheel is more or less the same way that we(consumers) of these platform have let social media become a part of our daily lives, the same way that the artwork functions is the same way we have left these platforms take over the lives of the consumers, and the way we have used these tools to also help these businesses promote their content as well as products, we use the these tools in the way we shop and live life on these platforms.</p>
<p>Using the tips and tricks that Riche used in his chapter 9 reading as well as the Dimara and Perin essay, with the interaction of data visualization. The tip that Riche talks about is the audience, that he focuses on (what the audience, who the targeted audience is) Looking at the way that audienceâ€™s knowledge on the topic and what the audience is expecting from the visualization.</p> 
<p>The artwork took in account to the audience that would be consuming the artwork I had to make it relatable to the context of the website and narrative of the website. The target audience is people that have integrated their lives with social media and the way that they use these platforms as well as the way they engage with the artwork and the tools that these businesses uses to lure in the consumers and customers. Where the Dimara and Perin focus on the human computer interaction services, giving tips on how the visualization/ artwork should attract the audience in the way the piece is setup, using the 7 tips and tricks that they give in their essay: </p>
<ol>
	<li><u>Dialogue</u>: this sees interaction as a cycle of communication acts, this is channelled through the input and the output from a computer perspective.</li>
	<li><u>Transmission</u>: this sees interaction as a transmission of information between the computer and the user. This is to rate a error-free information per time unit that is transferred over a communication channel </li>
	<li><u>Control</u>: sees interaction as minimization of error with respect to some user target. It is from a theory of continuous interaction via a system that consists of goals, inputs, outputs, feedbacks, feedforwards, and states. This is where the user is performing goal driven actions with the visualization system/ computer</li>
	<li><u>Tool use</u>: sees interaction as a series of tools that let a user interact with a computer it can be a tool to manipulate or build this is based on the activity theory, and the instrumental interaction model. These tools are mandatory for the user and the object of interest.<li>
	<li><u>Optimal behaviour</u>: sees interaction ad an adaptive behaviour under user capabilities, task, interface, and environment constrains. This is based on the rationality paradigm and adaptation theory. This how the humans and the systems can adapt to each other as the times moves, the behaviour that adapts and tests the systems.</li> 
	<li><u>Embodiment</u>: sees interaction as the act of being and participating in the world, this implied that the users should feel the technology, where the technology and the user are one thing that move and interact together, looking at the new tech such as VR where the user gets to interact with the visualization system.</li>
	<li><u>Experience</u>: sees interaction as phenomenon shaped by the user experience, momentary reactions and recall this is based on the experience research, this is where the human experience is places as key factor in how interaction unfolds. </li>
</ol>
<p>I implemented these 7 tips and tricks of how the audience interacts with the pieces, to make my spinning carrousel with the tools, it might spin with the code implemented in it but it work with giving the gist of the way that the website is setup and the way that it complements the website and the narrative that is being communicated on the website . <p>
