            <p>This graph of activity can be found on the information is beautiful website <a href= "(https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/ )">https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/ </a> this graph is about fishing out what is the truth in movies that are titled as “ based on a true story” the viewer is able to search which part of specific movies are (True; True-ish; false-ish; false and unknown) </p>

            <img src="../../Images/intro to 12.png" alt="Screenshot of data interactive/ driven artwork" title="Screenshot of artwork" width="90%" height="450">
            <p>The graph and results of the searches are first shown on a line/ strip graph with the different colours thar are allocated to the search words. Looking at the video above we see that the search is based on the hidden figures movie, and it goes through the “false” search option, at the bottom of the results you can see which part of the story is true and which part is just added fiction from the script writers.
            <p>The interactivity of this graph is from the fact that the viewer can hover the data/ result that is on display, we can see also that the data can be customized through a filter option where you can search specific parts of the movie through the Pedantry and sort filter options.
            They have different movies such as Selma; Hidden figures; The wolf of wall street; and 12 years a slave, just to name a few. How this could be part of the data driven artwork, is when you look at the strip/ line graph the art is how in how the colours are aligned to the specific time stamps in the movie. The art is how the colours create a pattern that can be followed </p>

            <p>The artwork is different per search and per movie, looking at the image below we can see that the work is not as cohesive as what a normal artwork would be/ look like.</p>
