        <h1><u>Critical reflection on the graphs</u></h1>
<p>For the graphs that are used in the S.M.A.L website, these graphs represent certain data and social activities that took place between the last 3 years, the graphs are simple to understand and easy to ready, they have the necessary details and information needed to understand the information that is being represented in the graphs.

The communication strategies might be lacking in terms of the UX and UI, there’s a lack of communication strategies, such as differentiating the 3 different categories, there’s some form unconventional way of drawing and representing the data, like the years that each bar fits into, in graph two the axis is shown on-top, where traditionally that axis would be at the toom, since it a conventional way of readying, left-to -right and up-down.</p>
<p>I made this graph like that with one of the axis being on-top, because I wanted to show the rise of activities and how much time people spend scrolling and intacting with each other on social media. </p>

<p>The graph is might be lacking a sense of linkage in terms of linking the data and the graph together, in such a way that it is visually appealing and appropriate to the data and the storyline that is being told with the data, since social media is seen as such a fun way to interact with each other and escape from reality a little longer, the way that the data is being represented needs to paly part into the way that people interact with these platforms</p>. 
<p>Thinking of the ways to make the data more relatable to the content and the context, the graphs should be more interactive and appealing to the eye and the audience, so that it draws the audience into thinking about the data and being affected by the way that the data is being represented so that they might be touched to change their behaviour and the amount of time they spend on these platforms. Not forgetting the rise of the new age money making tools that these platforms create, the way that people use these platforms to fight against the algorithm, especially on Instagram would be something is something that the graph is lacking. </p>
