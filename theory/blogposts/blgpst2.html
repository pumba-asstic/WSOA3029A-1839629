    <h1><u>Website  UX and UI review.</u></h1>
    <p>Reviewing the university of the Witwatersrand website, talking about the website design, UI and UX of the homepage. </p>
    <p><a href= "https://www.wits.ac.za/">www.wits.ac.za</a> the website link. Hoping onto to the landing page, we first see information about the university, the theme that is being used throughout the year. We then encounter the calendar date of any upcoming events at that being hosted by the university either online or in physically spaces. and new exciting news and what is happening through the space of the university, we then see the links of how to access the specific tools, such as the digital learning site (ulwazi) the covid 19 daily screening tool and how to access the data that is being provided by the university. </p>

    <br>
    <p>There also a digital (virtual VR) tour that you can partake in, the footer contains the contract details and all relevant links to other “sister sites” that university uses.
    The UX (user experience) is very simple there a search bar on top of the home page, where you can search keywords of relevant course and sites that you need to access, there’s also a Kudu Chat bar, that users can use to get information quicker and in a more understandable and relatable way. The UX is pretty simple, it is very user friendly (especially for first time users)  where it contains some of the important tabs and link to page such as campus life, teaching and learning,
    faculty and schools that are being offered at the university, the UI (the interface) is very organized and the colour scheme is constant with the university colours, the Kudu (logo Mascot) is visible in places where it needs to be seen, the reactiveness of the links work, the layout of the site is  easily useable, and the blocking of the information is constants as well as the font size and font type.</p>

    <img src="../../Images/kudu chatbox img.png" width="450" height="250" position="center"alt="Figure 3 Kudu chat box" title="Screen shot of website chatter box">
    <p>The representation of the site, is portraited by images, when linking on the hyperlinks, shown in fig 2 of the campus tours you can see the wits library lawns as the background image of that link with the Kudu chat box,  it is very responsive design and interactive feature to have on a site, the bot acts if  you are really talking to a person and not a bot that has automated responses. </p>
