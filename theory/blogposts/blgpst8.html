    <h1>Close reading and reflection on the Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin essay titled <i>What is interaction for Data Visualization?</i> </h1> 
<p>They talk about interaction for Data Visualization, looking into defining interaction in the human-computer interaction (HCI), looking that both senior and junior visualization of data and the views of how this data is being interacted with in HCI, they define Interaction for visualization, while looking at a better interaction of design practices and what visualization is as well as what it can be. </p>
<p>Dimara and Perin take definition of interaction as a concept that is used to describe a relationship between the human and the computer, the HCI views this as an opportunity for enriching interactivity with a computer system. They look at the visualization pipeline as an interaction that occurs at all stages of the visualization process of turning raw data into “views of the data”, this talks about the way that people( human ) interact with the computer systems, interaction and the visualization process is the same as turning data collected from research projects, experiments and interviews, raw data( numbers data ) into something that makes sense for both the computer and the viewer of that data, the interaction happens during the data turning process. </p>
<p>How the HCI defines interactions and visualization as two different entities, what the authors do in their definition is trying to see how these two entities relate and differ from each other. They definition “attempts to broaden the scope of interaction in visualization and is inclusive as it considers the perspectives of information visualization” (Evanthia Dimara; Charles Perin, 2020) </p>
<p>To make the definition make sense and come to some sort of a solid definition with trying to investigate what the “interaction for visualization” involves and takes. They discuss things such as what the interaction must involve and what it can involve.  This means that to give a clear definition is to look at the must haves and what it can involve, this is looking at the external and internal entities that help define Interaction for visualization.  These entities suggest things that interaction for visualization can involve and what they must involve. These entities that it must involve are things such as the dialogue that between the user and the visualization system that comes with an action-reaction pairs, the internal entities is the physical acts that are between the visualization system and the cognitive user.</p> 
<p><u>HCI has seven concepts that characterizes the interaction</u> </p>. 
<ol>
	<li><u>Dialogue:</u> this sees interaction as a cycle of communication acts, this is channelled through the input and the output from a computer perspective.</li> 
	<li><u>Transmission:</u>   this sees interaction as a transmission of information between the computer and the user. This is to rate a error-free information per time unit that is transferred over a communication channel </li>
	<li><u>Control:</u> sees interaction as minimization of error with respect to some user target. It is from a theory of continuous interaction via a system that consists of goals, inputs, outputs, feedbacks, feedforwards, and states. This is where the user is performing goal driven actions with the visualization system/ computer</li> 
	<li><u>Tool use:</u>  sees interaction as a series of tools that let a user interact with a computer it can be a tool to manipulate or build this is based on the activity theory, and the instrumental interaction model. These tools are mandatory for the user and the object of interest. </li>
	<li><u>Optimal behaviour:</u>  sees interaction ad an adaptive behaviour under user capabilities, task, interface, and environment constrains. This is based on the rationality paradigm and adaptation theory. This how the humans and the systems can adapt to each other as the times moves, the behaviour that adapts and tests the systems.</li> 
	<li><u>Embodiment:</u> sees interaction as the act of being and participating in the world, this implied that the users should feel the technology, where the technology and the user are one thing that move and interact together, looking at the new tech such as VR where the user gets to interact with the visualization system.</li> 
	<li><u>Experience:</u> sees interaction as phenomenon shaped by the user experience, momentary reactions and recall this is based on the experience research, this is where the human experience is places as key factor in how interaction unfolds. </li>
</ol>
<p>Looking at the above characteristics of what interaction for visualization might be we look at the fact that these characteristics  with HCI is that without the communication of the visualization system and the user, there would be any interaction for visualization, there is also a lot that goes into defining the term because of the evolving technologies a new ways that cognitive users can use to interact with data.</p>
