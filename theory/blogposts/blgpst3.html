        <h1><u>Critical Reflection of Website UI</u></h1>
        <p>The UI for social media and Live as we know it. <b>"S.M.A.L"</b> website.</p>
        <img src="../../Images/intro for blogpost 3 .png"  width="450" height="250" alt="S.M.A.L UX and UI" title="Screenshot of the S.M.A.L UX and UI">
        <p>User interface is pretty much the same as the Guyheadd website, that was created last semester, the menu/ navigation bar is 
        set on the right side of the screen, when you view the landing page, you are contacted by the image/ logo of the website and the slogan. It is set to draw your attention, with the bright colours of some social media platform logos get (pink, red, blue and green)</p>
        <p>There’s are different sections in the navigation bar that are dedicated to different parts of the website, such as the Datasets
        (this is where the data sets of specific research questions, answers and the use of API and different graphs, are going to be represented and shown)  Academical Work (is where the blogposts, wireframes, design thoughts and anything academical is going to be found on the site) 
        About and Contact section (This gives background of the site and where the authors as well as the references can be accessed and seen ), 
        this layout is going to be very organized , in terms of how simple and minimalistic it is.</p>
        <p>Making the UI of any site simple and minimalistic, makes it better for users to access, use and engage with the site, the SMAL site is not over-crowed with unnecessary information at first glance, the Layout of each section is continuing with the theme of being simple and minimalistic. Like the “academical work” where the blogposts are represented with images that deal with the topic at hand as well as a title, the images also act as links to the different posts that the reader/ users can use to access the posts. The contact and about section, is more or else using the Facebook profile layout, the owners/ team of the site are at the top of the page and the details follow, this is integrating some of the social media layouts into the site that investigates the uses of these platforms.
        The Data set section is also keeping to the theme, this time around the user gets to ask any kind of question that is interactive, and they get to pull the data from the API’s used and see the results using the different graphs that answer their questions as well as the researched questions that were made beforehand. </p>
        <p>Keeping it simple allows for maximum user engagement, not over-crowding and over loading pages with information and words. (as humans we are visual beings we see things before we see can read the meaning behind them) with this UI, I’m making use of that fact, and playing on the visual stimulation of the human mind, with having a ,lot visual representation visible on the site. </p>
