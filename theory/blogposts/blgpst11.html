            <h1>Critical reflection on the Viegas and Wattenberg (2007)reading , titled Artistic Data Visualization: beyond Visual Analytics. </h1>

<p>This article deals the projects in the field of artistic information visualization and a preliminary examination of how artists appropriate and repurpose “ scientific” techniques to create pieces that are actively guided analytical  reasoning and encourage a contextaulized reading of their subject matter. It deals with how the artists are able to reuse and repurpose scientific techniques to create visual information, that have statical data that needs to analyses. Using data visualization as the main tool of to “support the analytic reasoning” in their paper </p>

<p>Visual analytics is a combination of infovis (the role as an intelligence  tool for military and national security application)and mathematical deduction. This a was to create dynamical changes in the information spaces.. visual analytics has also become a main focus point in visualization. this created the artistic visualization tool/ technique.</p>
<p>Artistic visualization is as defined by the two authors as “ visualizations of data done by artists wit the intent of making art.” They break up their definition of artistic visualizations into two points: <p>
<ol>
	<li>That the artwork must be based on actual data, rather than metaphors or surface appearance of visualization. </li>
	<li>It avoids the issue of beauty. The artwork must focus on the “intent rather than surface aesthetics” the artwork must focus on why its being created and not how it looks. </li>
</ol>
<p>They point out why artistic visualization its being a popular tool to use, naming two factors that make this tool relevant: </p>
<ol>
    <li>New software tools that are being created and make it appropriate and easy to use for the artis in the production of the artwork. Tools such as flash and Processing. 
    <li>The inexpensive sophisticated software, Data is now a cultural discourse with the help of the internet.</li>
</ol>
<p>They give 4 different artistic visualization projects </p>

<ul>
    <li>Jason Salavon and the power of colored pixels </li>
    <li>Golan Levin and the power of numbers </li>
    <li>Last clock </li>
    <li>They rule</li>
</ul>
<p>The above-mentioned projects share one common feature that sets them apart from the traditional visualization tools. Each project embodies a forceful point of view. The artwork is derived from the power and the artist is able to create and analyse many different data sets in one. </p>
<p>The authors have found that the sudden interest in artistic visualization is very much orientated in the many sophisticated visualization techniques that have been developed in academia. It is a spaces that has interdisciplinary traditions. Artistic visualization is basically making artwork based of scientifical data, making the artwork interactive, understandable and relatable to the viewer, using the data in a sophisticated way as well as using software that is able to interpret the data. </p>
