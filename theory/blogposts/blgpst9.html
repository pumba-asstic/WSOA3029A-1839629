            <h1>Analysis: information is beautiful- Interactivity as semiotic device.</h1>
            <p>The graph of interactivity that is being analysed is <a href= “https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/#activities”>informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/#activities </a>this set is found on the <a href = “https://informationisbeautiful.net”>informationisbeautiful.net <a></p>
            
                <img src="../../Images/2021-11-15 (1).png" alt="Coronavirus- infographic datapack "width="90%" height= "450" title="Screenshot of Graph">
            
            <p>We are looking at the interactivity that service its role as a semiotic device, we know that semiotics is a sign that is used to represent a certain object or meaning. It is also a theory used mostly by Stuart Hall, that is a study of signs and symbols. We are looking at the signs and the symbols that are being used in this visualization.</p> 
            <p>This graph that is being takes about COVID 19, the data is given via the Universe labs and NUEKER researchers, this graph is looking at the weekly stats of covid 19 per country and giving data that is about the vaccination drive that each country hosts, it also has another graph that is looking at the hotspots of covid 19 looking at the daily cases that are being recorded per country. This graph has interactivity implemented into it via the search bar, where the user can search which country, they would like to see that stats of, as well as a scroll bar which shows and highlights the different countries that are in the high numbers of the hotspot countries, the semiotics that are implemented is also given to in a form a flat world map that changes colour when interacting with the scroll bar. </p>
            <p>These graphs get updates weekly, with new stats and new interactive ways to understand the data better on these graphs how this links to my website is in the way that the graphs will interact with the data, of how social media has affected the business world and how it has created its own new trends and business rules. The activity from the graphs form the information is beautiful website comes with many ways that the data can be analyse, you can see the different ways that race, ethnicity, age and other health factors play a role in the stats. The viewer can also do many other things with these graphs such as looking at which household items/ materials are best used as masks and the protection rate they provide you with.</p>
