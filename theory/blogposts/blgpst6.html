        <h1><u>Case Study: Varieties of Intimate Relationship</u></h1>
        <p>This is a case study about the different intimate relationships exist, analysing and looking at the representation of the data and the way the data is being communicated, this graph is found on the <i>Information is beautiful </i> website.<a href= "https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-varieties-of-intimate-relationship/"> Information is beautiful</a></p>
        <p>The representation and communication of the data is based on the Thelal Oweis article titled <i>A literature review on communication strategies in language learning.</i> What Oweis states as the strategies, these are linked to verbal communication, that one can implement into either verbal, physical or written communication. He states them a criteria that was established by Tarone in the 1980’s 
        <ol>
        	<li>A speaker desires to communicate meaning X to a listener </li>
        	<li>The speaker believes the linguistic or sociolinguistic structure desired to communicate meaning X is unavailable, or is not shared with the listener, the speaker chooses to:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid or abandon the attempt to communicate meaning X.</li>
                <li>Attempt alternative ways to communicate meaning X, the speaker stops trying alternatives when it seems clear to them that there’s shared meaning.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>He also takes it a step further in giving ways to identify the criteria given by Nayar in 1988:</p>
        <ol>
    	    <li>Noticeable deviance from native speaker norm.</li>
        	<li>Apparent, obvious desire on the part of the speaker to communicate meaning to listeners as indicated by overt and cover discourse clues</li>
        	<li>Evident and sometimes repetitive attempts to seek alternative ways including repairs and appeals, to communicate and negotiate meaning</li>
        	<li>Overt pausological, hesitational and other temporal feature in the speaker’s communicative behaviour.</li>
        	<li>Presence of paralinguistic and kinaesthetic features. </li>
        </ol></p>
        <p>Looking at the graph below. We can see that the researchers communicated their meaning in a more casual way of relaying meaning and certain ideas, it gives a brief understanding of how these intimate relationships are all interlinked together and the different types and sub-categories that they all have.<p> 
        <img src="../../Images/case study image bp6.png" width="100%" height="450"alt="graph of intimate relationships" title="case study graph">
        
        <p>Looking at the representation of the graph and the information the flow of the information shows the interlinkages that each of these type of relationships has, from the top of the graph where it states the common type of I.R(intimate relationships) we get, that being the non-monogamy, celibacy, and monogamy. The information is then split into more detail, details that are common which these type of I.R’s unless you actively participate in them. The information is spread equally and is less cluttered where the meaning and sub-categories are defined separately, and we get are also given examples of these definition.
       The way that the data is begin represented is very simple and making it easy for the user/ reader to understand what is what. Looking at the circles that thee I.R are defined in could be a meaning of how we as humans interact with each other on an intimate level. The circles represent the linkages between each person and how they choose to define their relationship. </p>
