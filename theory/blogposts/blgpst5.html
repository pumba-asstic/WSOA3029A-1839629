        <h1><u>Close reflection: chapter 6 Knaflic reading</u></h1> 

        <p>Dissecting model visuals, what knafic talks about in this chapter is the different models and the different ways that one can annotate, represent and communicate information with these models, through six different parts that re-emphasize information and gets the audience’s attention through these parts
        <ol>
        	<li>Colour: the colour of the graph to emphasize information, and that also draws the audiences’ eyes to the information. The brighter the colour the better attention is drawn to the audience for them to read that information clearly and understand it. </li>
        	<li>Size: the size of the graphs, the size of the content, the size of the bars inside a bar graph, the size of the line n a line graph and the size of the pie slices in a pie chart. This is one aspect where size does matter to draw the attention on the information that you want the audience to pay the most attention to, e.g Making the pie chart slices with the most percentage be cut from the rest of the chart to emphasize the importance of that particular information. </li> 
        	<li>Visual: the visuals you choose to represent the information, like in a pie chart, looking at the above example, looking at the way you can play around with the visuals to re-emphasize the information that is being presented, the way you choose to showcase the information is important to the message that you trying to relay with that information. </li>
        	<li>Relative ordering of data: the placement of the data and the way you reorder them and structure them, play a big role in the message and the information you are trying to relay, keeping the space and the reordering of the information/ data less cluttered helps with making the message clear and understandable to the audience. </li> 
        	<li>Alignment: alignment refers tot eh way that the data is related and linked to the message that is being told, the information / data need to be linked to each other, the information cannot be different to the way that things are being visualized and from what the context of the information is about.  The information and the visuals must be interlinked </li>
        	<li>Positioning of the elements: this refers to where you decide to put the information withing the presentation and the where you decide to put each element, graphs and any other data visualization tool, needs to be thought out and planned accordingly so that the space is not cluttered and the information is still readable and understandable to the audience, this also refers to labels and annotating elements of the graph, the elements needs to make sense to the message and the audience, and still be useful to the audience.</li> 
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>this chapter ties in with how clutter should be your enemy, making the data visualization tool clutter is where you lose the interest and the attention of the audience, this is where the planning and the carefully thinking out the graphs should be important. The usage of the above elements should help keep the audiences attention.
