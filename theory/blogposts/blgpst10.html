            <h1> Reflection of the S.M.A.L interactive datasets</h1>
            <p>Critical reflection on the representation and communication strategies using interactivity S.M.A.L. interactive Data-Visualisation.</p> 
<p>The interactivity that is used in the website it tests the data where the viewer can view the different numbers where the business on social media grew over the past 3 years (2019-2021) looking at the data and being able to search stats of business profiles that were created and businesses that are still running well and being actively used.</p> 
<p>The data/ the graph will be looking at the different tools that are being used on the social media platforms, tools such as the shop (view shop option) where customers can order items via these business social media accounts instead of their website. Looking at the Facebook “market place” and looking at how many people are selling and actually having positive sales on these spaces. </p>

<p>The graph is in a form of a circle diagram, where the circle will be representing the social media business tools pool. This will help with communicating the percentage that the tool is being used at its fullest. the interactivity comes in a form of a search bar where you can search the tool that has your interest.</p> 
<p>This graph communicates the purpose of data in my view, correctly and precisely. Trying to make sense to the viewer and making it clear and understandable to the viewer. The aesthetics / art side of the graph is pretty simple, it’s a circle diagram that is being used with different colours that are allocated to the data that is being searched. 
the interactivity comes with the viewer being able to customize their search and being able to compare the online/ social media business tools. </p>
