            <h1><u>Summary of the Li (2020) text about Data visualization</u></h1>
        <p>The text talks and discusses the relationship between data visualization and aesthetics, as well as gives a clear definition of what is data and information, gives the characteristics of traditional visualization. </p>
        <p>The history of data visualization started in the second century, with rock drawings, ancient social and other visual representations that were used to investigate the world and also record historical events. The data visualization has evolved from the invention of the computer technology which made data visualization and representation as well as presentation easier, effective, and quicker. The software that was installed with the beginning of the computer tech advanced the way that data is being visualized, manipulated, and analysed.  Li says that data visualization is the communication of understanding the data.</p>
        <p>Traditional data visualization has many different advantages to what the computer tech data visualization has. It has the ability to be represent a number of different data quicker at the same time, it enables the viewer to identify the emergent properties of the data with new insights, it can be used for product quality control and form immediate data analysis, it also enhances the understanding of the large-scale data and the small-scale data. Li draws his definition from five different scholars that defined what data visualization could be/is. </p>
        <p>What is data visualization?  It is described as the usage of computer supported, interactive visual representation of data, the transformation of quantified data that is not visual into visual information and the representation and presentation of data that exploits the human visual perception, presentation of data in pictorial or graphic format using software. It can be classified into two major sub-categories. Information visualization (used to visually represent abstract data e.g. business data) and scientific visualization (represents scientific data that is usually physically based e.g. Human body, the environment, etc) </p>
        <p>Li goes into the differences between what is data and information, stating that  Data refers to the raw, unprocessed information that is not recognized as having any meaning, it can be organized in different forms, it is “raw and it simply exists data has no significance beyond its existence( in and of itself)”  Data is split into two types Primary data (this is the data  that is collected from census, studies, interviews, It is the raw unprocessed data from different things such as experiments, research, surveys etc ) and Secondary data (information contained data, from records, it the raw data that is processed and statistically analysed to extract, this things such as year books, research report and census report), where information is begin referred to as the processed data, that is understandable and recognized by humans and is considered as useful data </p>
        <p>Li gives a clear understanding in how data visualization came about and how raw data is processed into more useful and understandable information and how it can be represented to society, remembering that information is raw data that is processed in a more useful and understandable manner. </p>
